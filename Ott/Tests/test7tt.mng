We can TeX-typeset symbolic terms of the language, e.g.
\[ [[ (\X<:Top. \x:X.x) [Top->Top] ]]\]
and concrete terms
\[ [[ :concrete: \Z1<:Top. \x:Z1.x ]]\]
and similarly judgements etc, e.g.
\[ [[G |- t : T ]] \]
   
Here is an extract of the syntax:

\testSevengrammartabular{\testSevent\testSevenafterlastrule}

and a single semantic rule:

\[\testSevendruletinXXTwo{}\]

and a judgement definition:

\testSevendefnSA

One can also include a `defns' collection of judgements, or the complete definition.
