\title{\texttt{test7t.mng}: A Test of Ott \TeX{} Filtering Workflow}
\author{\texttt{ott}}
\maketitle

This illustrates support for using Ott as a munger. 
There are command-line argument \verb+-tex_wrap+ and \verb+-tex_filter+.  
Typical usage would be something like this:
\begin{verbatim}
test7afilter: tests/test7b.ott tests/test7t.mng
        bin/ott  -tex out.sty 						\
               -tex_show_meta false                                     \
               -tex_wrap false                                          \
               -tex_name_prefix	ott					\
               -tex_filter tests/test7t.mng out.tex                  \
        tests/test7b.ott 			      		\
        && ($(LATEX) out; $(DVIPS) out -o)
\end{verbatim}

The \verb+-tex_wrap false+ turns off output of the default \TeX{}
document preamble, so the generated file \verb+out.sty+ just contains
\TeX{} definitions.  The \verb+-tex_filter+ argument takes two
filenames, a source and a destination.  It filters the source file,
(roughly) replacing any string found within \verb+[[[+ \verb+]]]+ by
the tex pretty-print of its parse.  This parsing is done w.r.t.~a new generated nonterminal 
\verb+user_syntax+ which is a union of all the user's grammar.  

At present (unlike the previous munger) munged strings are not automatically
put within \verb+$+ \verb+$+, and there is no analogue of \verb+<[+
\verb+]>+.  We probably want to tune up the tex to make it more
convenient, e.g.~control whether 
definitions are in centering environments (or not), etc.

The lexing pays some attention to \TeX{} comments, but may not get it
right.  It turns any sequence of \verb+[+ (resp. of \verb+]+) of
length $n+1$ for $n>2$ into a literal sequence of length $n$.

This file shows a definition of F$_{<:}$.

\section{Extracts -- What You See}
We can TeX-typeset terms of the language, e.g.
\[ [[ (\X<:Top. \x:X.x) [Top->Top] ]]\]

\[ [[ :user_syntax__t: :concrete:  zz ]]\]
and similarly judgements etc, e.g.
\[ [[G |- t : T ]] \]

Here is an extract of the syntax:

\ottgrammartabular{\ottt\ottafterlastrule}

and a single semantic rule:

\[\ottdruletinXXTwo{}\]

and a judgement definition:

\ottdefnSA

(can also include a `defns' collection of judgements).
