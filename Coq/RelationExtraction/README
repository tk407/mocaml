II - INSTALLATION

  1 - Prerequisites
    You need to have Ocaml and the svn's trunk version of Coq (>r14783) 
installed. The COQBIN (/usr/local/bin/ by default) and the COQDIR (/usr/local/
by default) environment varaibles must be set prior to use this plugin.

  2 - Buildind the plugin
    Simply type ``make'' in the plugin source directory. This will build the 
plugin and laungh a test suite, which contains many examples.

III - USAGE

  First of all, many examples are given in the ``test'' directory. They show
many possible usage of the plugin. To use the plugin in a Coq file, you need
to add two lines at top of this file:
    Add LoadPath "<path>".
    Declare ML Module "relation_extraction_plugin".
where <path> is the plugin source directory. Then the relation extraction 
command can be used everywhere in the file. The syntax of this command is:
    Extraction Relation [Single] [Relaxed] \
      rel mode [with rel1 mode1 rel2 mode2...]
where rel, rel1, rel2 are inductive definitions of relations and mode, mode1,
mode2 their respective extraction modes. When the Single flag is set, the plugin
only extract the first relation (rel) whereas when it is not set, all the 
relations and their depedencies (Fixpoints, Defintions, Inductive data types) 
will be extracted. The Relaxed flag activates an optimisation relative to 
non-deterministic specifications. Modes are given as an integer list ([1], [1 3] 
for examples). Each integer is an argument (of the inductive relation) number,
starting with 1.
