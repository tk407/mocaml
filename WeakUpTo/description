Description: 
  This contribution is the formalisation of a paper that appeared in
  Proc. of ICALP 2005: "Up-to Techniques for Weak Bisimulation".
  First we define a framework for defining up-to techniques for weak
  bisimulation in a modular way. Then we prove the correctness of some
  new up-to techniques, based on termination guarantees. Notably, a
  generalisation of Newman's Lemma to commutation results is
  established.
