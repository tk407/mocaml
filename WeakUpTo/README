This contribution is the formalisation of a paper that appeared in
Proc. of ICALP 2005: "Up-to Techniques for Weak Bisimulation".  

First we define a framework for defining up-to techniques for weak
bisimulation in a modular way. Then we prove the correctness of some
new up-to techniques, based on termination guarantees. Notably, a
generalisation of Newman's Lemma to commutation results is
established.


Structure of the project:

- Relations: 
	Definition of binary relations, auxiliary results 

- Functions: 
	Functions over relations

- Reductions:
	Labelled Transition Systems (LTS), Weak transition relation

- Settings:
	General setting for behavioural equivalences, evolution,
	simulation, bisimulation...

- Theory: 
	Correctness of the up-to techniques corresponding to the
	notions of (weak) monotonic functions, or controlled
	simulations

- Monotonic: 
	Study of the class of monotonic functions (Lemma 1.7 and 1.8)

- WeakMonotonic: 
	Study of the class of weakly monotonic functions (Lemma 2.3)

- Diagrams: 
	Results about commutation diagrams

- Controlled: 
	Study of controlled simulations

- Application: 
	Application to the bisimulation case
