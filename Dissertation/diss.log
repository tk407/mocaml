[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 To write an OCaml framework for lightweight threading. This f
ramework should be defined from basic semantics and have these semantics repres
ented in a theorem prover setting for verification. The verification should inc
lude proofs of basic monadic laws. This theorem prover representation should be
 extracted to OCaml where the extracted code should be as faithful to the repre
sentation as possible. The extracted code should be able to run OCaml code conc
urrently.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 Concurrent computation has became the norm for most applicati
ons with the rise of faster systems often with multiple cores. This concurrency
 can be exploited on multiple levels ranging from hardware supported instructio
n and thread level parallelism to software based heavy and lightweight models.[

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 This project aims to model lightweight, cooperative concurren
cy. No threads are exposed to the underlying operating system or hardware and a
 blocking operation on the process level will still block all internal threads 
and the threads themselves expose the points of possible interleaving.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 There have been two very successful frameworks, LWT\cite{LWT}
 and Async\cite{Async} that both provided the primitives for concurrent develop
ment in OCaml however neither is supported by a clear semantic description as t
heir main focus was ease of use and speed.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 There have been a lot of work on how exactly to formulate the
 semantics of concurrent and distributed systems. Some of the most common model
s for lightweight concurrency are captured and delimited continuations, trampol
ined style, continuation and promise monads and event based programming. This w
ork focuses on the continuation monad style.[]

 \textbf{con} $, where $ \alpha $ is a type parameter describing the type of op
eration enclosed and three key operations[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 The third operation is fork, which is the way to spawn new th
reads (two in this particular case). The approach taken in this work is to have
 fork take two arguments, evaluate the two paths concurrently. The concurrency 
is achieved by reducing each path step by step based on some scheduler. When ei
ther path reduced to a value it returns a boxed up pair of results.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 These semantics can be modelled in logic, in particular a log
ic used by proof assistant. Mechanisation of semantics in proof assistant has b
een accepted as a way of formal verification of properties about said semantics
 \cite{benton2008mechanized,blazy2009mechanized, blazy2006formal, leroy2009form
al}. Most often used proof assistants include Coq \cite{Coq}, HOL and Isabelle.
 There have been much effort to make this mechanisation as easy as possible wit
h tools like Ott\cite{Ott}, which enable working semanticists to describe their
 language in a simple, ascii-art like style while versatile in destination lang
uages, including the above mentioned proof assistants, latex and some direct ML
 representations.[]

[]\OT1/cmtt/m/n/8 This logical representation is more amenable to proofs than t
o actual execution and the evaluation with respect to other implementations, wh
ich is why much research has gone into extraction of these representations into
 a functional programming language including OCaml and Haskell.[]
